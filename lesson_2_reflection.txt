	to not create unreachable commits.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	The result is a complete code with the features on each branch. We represent them in a diagram
	because it is easier to follow the branch that way and not get lost in the commits you made.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

	Git can save time by merging but it can be annoying when little things like a extra space is found.
